## Overview

The Dashboard is your central monitoring hub. It displays real-time metrics, charts, and alerts about your entire PKI infrastructure through customizable widgets.

## Widgets

### Statistics Card
Displays four key counters:
- **Total CAs** — Root and Intermediate Certificate Authorities
- **Active Certificates** — Valid, non-revoked certificates
- **Pending CSRs** — Certificate Signing Requests awaiting approval
- **Expiring Soon** — Certificates expiring within 30 days

### Certificate Trend
A line chart showing certificate issuance over time. Hover over data points to see exact counts.

### Status Distribution
Pie chart showing the breakdown of certificate states:
- **Valid** — Within validity period and not revoked
- **Expiring** — Expires within 30 days
- **Expired** — Past the "Not After" date
- **Revoked** — Explicitly revoked

### Next Expiry
Lists certificates expiring soonest. Click any certificate to navigate to its details. Configure the threshold in **Settings → General**.

### System Status
Shows the health of UCM services:
- ACME server (enabled/disabled)
- SCEP server
- CRL auto-regeneration
- OCSP responder
- Service uptime

### Recent Activity
A live feed of the latest operations: certificate issuance, revocations, imports, user logins. Updates in real-time via WebSocket.

### Certificate Authorities
Quick view of all CAs with their type (Root/Intermediate) and certificate count.

### ACME Accounts
Lists registered ACME client accounts and their order counts.

## Customization

### Rearranging Widgets
Drag any widget by its header to reposition it. The layout uses a responsive grid that adapts to your screen size.

### Showing/Hiding Widgets
Click the **eye icon** in the page header to toggle individual widget visibility. Hidden widgets are remembered across sessions.

### Layout Persistence
Your layout configuration is saved per-user in the browser. It persists across sessions and devices sharing the same browser profile.

## Overview

Certificate Authorities (CAs) form the foundation of your PKI. UCM supports multi-level CA hierarchies with Root CAs, Intermediate CAs, and Sub-CAs.

## CA Types

### Root CA
A self-signed certificate that serves as the trust anchor. Root CAs should ideally be kept offline in production environments. In UCM, a Root CA has no parent.

### Intermediate CA
Signed by a Root CA or another Intermediate CA. Used for day-to-day certificate signing. Intermediate CAs limit the blast radius if compromised.

### Sub-CA
Any CA signed by an Intermediate CA, creating deeper hierarchy levels.

## Views

### Tree View
Displays the full CA hierarchy as a collapsible tree. Parent-child relationships are visualized with indentation and connecting lines.

### List View
Flat table with sortable columns: Name, Type, Status, Certificates issued, Expiry date.

### Organization View
Groups CAs by their Organization (O) field. Useful for multi-tenant setups where different departments manage separate CA trees.

## Creating a CA

### Create Root CA
1. Click **Create** → **Root CA**
2. Fill in the Subject fields (CN, O, OU, C, ST, L)
3. Select the key algorithm (RSA 2048/4096, ECDSA P-256/P-384)
4. Set the validity period (typically 10-20 years for Root CAs)
5. Optionally select a certificate template
6. Click **Create**

### Create Intermediate CA
1. Click **Create** → **Intermediate CA**
2. Select the **Parent CA** (must have a private key)
3. Fill in Subject fields
4. Set the validity period (typically 5-10 years)
5. Click **Create**

> ⚠ The Intermediate CA validity cannot exceed its parent CA's validity.

## Importing a CA

Import existing CA certificates via:
- **PEM file** — Certificate in PEM format
- **DER file** — Binary DER format
- **PKCS#12** — Certificate + private key bundle (requires password)

When importing without a private key, the CA can verify certificates but cannot sign new ones.

## Exporting a CA

Export formats:
- **PEM** — Base64-encoded certificate
- **DER** — Binary format
- **PKCS#12 (P12/PFX)** — Certificate + private key + chain, password-protected

> 💡 PKCS#12 export includes the full certificate chain and is ideal for backup.

## Private Keys

CAs with a **key icon** (🔑) have a private key stored in UCM and can sign certificates. CAs without a key are trust-only — they validate chains but cannot issue.

### Key Storage
Private keys are encrypted at rest in the UCM database. For higher security, consider using an HSM provider (see HSM page).

## Chain Repair

If parent-child relationships are broken (e.g., after import), use **Chain Repair** to automatically rebuild the hierarchy based on Issuer/Subject matching.

## Renewing a CA

Renewing re-issues the CA certificate with:
- Same subject and key
- New validity period
- New serial number

Existing certificates signed by the CA remain valid.

## Deleting a CA

> ⚠ Deleting a CA removes it from UCM but does NOT revoke certificates it has issued. Revoke certificates first if needed.

Deletion is blocked if the CA has child CAs. Delete or re-parent children first.

## Overview

The User Certificates page manages mTLS client certificates enrolled via the **Account → mTLS** tab. Unlike regular certificates, these are specifically tied to user accounts for mutual TLS authentication.

Certificates here are fully managed by UCM — they are stored in the database with private keys, and can be exported, revoked, or deleted at any time.

## Enrolling a Certificate

1. Go to **Account → mTLS** tab
2. Click **Enroll Certificate**
3. The system generates a key pair and issues a client certificate signed by your mTLS CA
4. The certificate appears on this page and can be used for mTLS login

## Certificate Status

- **Valid** — Within validity period and not revoked
- **Expiring** — Will expire within 30 days
- **Expired** — Past the "Not After" date
- **Revoked** — Explicitly revoked, published in CRL

## Exporting a Certificate

1. Select a certificate → **Export**
2. Choose format:
   - **PEM** — Certificate + private key + CA chain in text format
   - **PKCS#12** — Binary bundle, password-protected (min 8 characters)
3. Click **Download**

The exported file can be imported into browsers, operating systems, or API clients for mTLS authentication.

> ⚠ PKCS#12 password must be at least 8 characters.

## Revoking a Certificate

1. Select a certificate → **Revoke**
2. Choose a revocation reason:
   - Key Compromise
   - Affiliation Changed
   - Superseded
   - Cessation of Operation
   - Unspecified
3. Confirm the revocation

> ⚠ Revoking a certificate immediately prevents mTLS login with that certificate. Revocation is permanent.

## Deleting a Certificate

Delete removes both the certificate and the user-certificate association. Only admins and operators can delete.

> ⚠ Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

## Permissions

| Role | View | Export | Revoke | Delete |

  // ===================================================================
  csrs: {
    title: 'Certificate Signing Requests',
    content: `
## Overview

Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) allow external systems to request certificates without exposing their private keys. The CSR contains the public key and subject information; the private key stays with the requester.

## Tabs

### Pending
CSRs awaiting review and signing. New CSRs appear here after upload.

### History
Previously signed or rejected CSRs, with links to the resulting certificates.

## Uploading a CSR

1. Click **Upload CSR**
2. Either paste PEM text or upload a PEM/DER file
3. UCM validates the CSR signature and displays the details
4. The CSR appears in the Pending tab

## Reviewing a CSR

Click a CSR to view:
- **Subject** — CN, O, OU, C, etc.
- **SANs** — DNS names, IP addresses, emails
- **Key info** — Algorithm, size, public key fingerprint
- **Signature** — Algorithm and validity

## Signing a CSR

1. Select a pending CSR
2. Click **Sign**
3. Choose the **Signing CA** (must have a private key)
4. Set the **validity period** in days
5. Optionally apply a template for Key Usage and extensions
6. Click **Sign**

The resulting certificate appears in the Certificates page.

## Adding a Private Key

After signing, you can attach a private key to the certificate for PKCS#12 export. Click **Add Key** on the signed certificate.

> 💡 This is useful when the requester sends both the CSR and the key securely.

## Deleting CSRs

Delete removes the CSR from UCM. If the CSR was already signed, the resulting certificate is not affected.
`

  // ===================================================================
  templates: {
    title: 'Certificate Templates',
    content: `
## Overview

Templates define reusable certificate profiles. Instead of manually configuring Key Usage, Extended Key Usage, validity, and subject fields each time, apply a template to pre-fill everything.

## Template Types

### End-Entity Templates
For server certificates, client certificates, code signing, and email protection. These templates typically set:
- **Key Usage** — Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
- **Extended Key Usage** — Server Auth, Client Auth, Code Signing, Email Protection

### CA Templates
For creating Intermediate CAs. These set:
- **Key Usage** — Certificate Sign, CRL Sign
- **Basic Constraints** — CA:TRUE, optional path length

## Creating a Template

1. Click **Create Template**
2. Enter a **name** and optional description
3. Select the template **type** (End-Entity or CA)
4. Configure **Subject defaults** (O, OU, C, ST, L)
5. Select **Key Usage** flags
6. Select **Extended Key Usage** values
7. Set the **default validity** period in days
8. Click **Create**

## Using Templates

When issuing a certificate or signing a CSR, select a template from the dropdown. The template pre-fills:
- Subject fields (you can override them)
- Key Usage and Extended Key Usage
- Validity period

  crlocsp: {
    title: 'CRL & OCSP',
    content: `
## Overview

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) allow clients to verify whether a certificate has been revoked. UCM supports both mechanisms.

## CRL Management

### What is a CRL?
A CRL is a signed list of revoked certificate serial numbers, published by a CA. Clients download the CRL and check if a certificate's serial number appears in it.

### CRL per CA
Each CA has its own CRL. The CRL list shows all your CAs with:
- **Revoked count** — Number of certificates in the CRL
- **Last regenerated** — When the CRL was last rebuilt
- **Auto-regeneration** — Whether automatic CRL updates are enabled

### Regenerating a CRL
Click **Regenerate** to rebuild a CA's CRL immediately. This is useful after revoking certificates.

### Auto-Regeneration
Enable auto-regeneration to automatically rebuild the CRL whenever a certificate is revoked. Toggle this per CA.

### CRL Distribution Point (CDP)
The CDP URL is embedded in certificates so clients know where to download the CRL. Copy the URL from the CRL details.

\`\`\`
https://your-server:8443/api/v2/crl/{ca_id}
\`\`\`

### Downloading CRLs
Download CRLs in DER or PEM format for distribution to clients or integration with other systems.

## OCSP Responder

### What is OCSP?
OCSP provides real-time certificate status checking. Instead of downloading an entire CRL, clients send a query for a specific certificate and get an immediate response.

### OCSP Status
The OCSP section shows:
- **Responder status** — Active or inactive
- **Total queries** — Number of OCSP requests processed
- **Cache hit rate** — Percentage of queries served from cache

### AIA URL
The Authority Information Access (AIA) URL is embedded in certificates to tell clients where the OCSP responder is located.

\`\`\`
https://your-server:8443/api/v2/crl/ocsp
\`\`\`

### OCSP vs CRL

| Feature | CRL | OCSP |
|---------|-----|------|
| Update frequency | Periodic | Real-time |
| Bandwidth | Full list each time | Single query |
| Privacy | No tracking | Server sees queries |
| Offline support | Yes (cached) | Requires connectivity |

> 💡 Best practice: enable both CRL and OCSP for maximum compatibility.

    title: 'SCEP Server',
    content: `
## Overview

The Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) enables network devices — routers, switches, firewalls, MDM-managed endpoints — to automatically request and obtain certificates.

## Tabs

### Requests
View all SCEP enrollment requests:
- **Pending** — Awaiting manual approval (if auto-approve is off)
- **Approved** — Successfully issued
- **Rejected** — Denied by an administrator

### Configuration
Configure the SCEP server:
- **Enable/Disable** — Toggle the SCEP service
- **Signing CA** — Select which CA signs SCEP-enrolled certificates
- **CA Identifier** — The identifier devices use to locate the correct CA
- **Auto-Approve** — Automatically approve requests with valid challenge passwords

### Challenge Passwords
Manage per-CA challenge passwords. Devices must include a valid challenge password in their enrollment request to authenticate.

- **View password** — Show the current challenge for a CA
- **Regenerate** — Create a new challenge password (invalidates the old one)

### Information
Displays the SCEP endpoint URL and integration instructions.

## SCEP Enrollment Flow

1. Device sends a **GetCACert** request to get the CA certificate
2. Device generates a key pair and creates a CSR
3. Device wraps the CSR with the **challenge password** and sends a **PKCSReq**
4. UCM validates the challenge password
5. If auto-approve is on, UCM signs and returns the certificate
6. If auto-approve is off, an admin reviews and approves/rejects

## SCEP URL

\`\`\`
https://your-server:8443/scep
\`\`\`

Devices need this URL plus the CA identifier to enroll.

## Approving/Rejecting Requests

For pending requests (auto-approve disabled):
1. Review the request details (subject, key type, challenge)
2. Click **Approve** to sign and issue the certificate
3. Or click **Reject** with a reason

> ⚠ Challenge passwords are transmitted in the SCEP request. Always use HTTPS for the SCEP endpoint.

  acme: {
    title: 'ACME',
    content: `
## Overview

UCM supports ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) in two modes:

- **Let's Encrypt Client** — Obtain public TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt (or any ACME CA)
- **Local ACME Server** — Built-in ACME server for internal PKI automation with multi-CA support

## Let's Encrypt

### Client Tab
Manage your Let's Encrypt account:
- Register a new account or use an existing one
- View active orders and their status
- Request new certificates via ACME protocol

### DNS Providers
Configure DNS-01 challenge providers for domain validation. Supported providers include:
- Cloudflare
- AWS Route 53
- Google Cloud DNS
- DigitalOcean
- OVH
- And more

Each provider requires API credentials specific to the DNS service.

### Domains
Map your domains to DNS providers. When requesting a certificate for a domain, UCM uses the mapped provider to create DNS-01 challenge records.

1. Click **Add Domain**
2. Enter the domain name (e.g., \`example.com\` or \`*.example.com\`)
3. Select the DNS provider
4. Click **Save**

> 💡 Wildcard certificates (\`*.example.com\`) require DNS-01 validation.

## Local ACME Server

### Configuration
- **Enable/Disable** — Toggle the built-in ACME server
- **Default CA** — Select which CA signs certificates by default
- **Terms of Service** — Optional ToS URL for clients

### ACME Directory URL
\`\`\`
https://your-server:8443/acme/directory
\`\`\`

Clients like certbot, acme.sh, or Caddy use this URL to discover the ACME endpoints.

### Local Domains (Multi-CA)
Map internal domains to specific CAs. This allows different domains to be signed by different CAs.

1. Click **Add Domain**
2. Enter the domain (e.g., \`internal.corp\` or \`*.dev.local\`)
3. Select the **Issuing CA**
4. Enable/disable **Auto-Approve**
5. Click **Save**

### CA Resolution Order
When an ACME client requests a certificate, UCM determines the signing CA in this order:
1. **Local Domain mapping** — Exact match, then parent domain match
2. **DNS Domain mapping** — The CA configured for the DNS provider
3. **Global default** — The CA set in ACME server configuration
4. **First available** — Any CA with a private key

### Accounts
View registered ACME client accounts:
- Account ID and contact email
- Registration date
- Number of orders

### History
Browse all certificate issuance orders:
- Order status (pending, valid, invalid, ready)
- Domain names requested
- Signing CA used
- Issuance timestamp

`
  },

  // ===================================================================
  truststore: {
    title: 'Trust Store',
    content: `
## Overview

The Trust Store manages trusted CA certificates used for chain validation. Import root and intermediate CAs from external sources or synchronize with the operating system's trust store.

## Certificate Categories

- **Root CA** — Self-signed trust anchors
- **Intermediate** — CAs signed by root or other intermediates
- **Client Auth** — Certificates for mTLS client authentication
- **Code Signing** — Certificates for code signature verification
- **Custom** — Manually categorized certificates

## Importing Certificates

### From File
Upload certificate files in these formats:
- **PEM** — Base64-encoded (single or bundled)
- **DER** — Binary format
- **PKCS#7 (P7B)** — Certificate chain

### From URL
Fetch a certificate from a remote HTTPS endpoint. UCM downloads and imports the server's certificate chain.

### Paste PEM
Paste PEM-encoded certificate text directly into the text area.

### Sync from System
Import all trusted CAs from the operating system's trust store. This populates UCM with the same root CAs trusted by the OS (e.g., Mozilla's CA bundle on Linux).

> 💡 Sync from System is a one-time import. Changes to the OS trust store are not automatically reflected.

## Managing Entries

- **Filter by purpose** — Narrow the list by certificate category
- **Search** — Find certificates by subject name
- **Export** — Download individual certificates in PEM format
- **Delete** — Remove a certificate from the trust store

## Use Cases

### Chain Validation
When verifying a certificate chain, UCM checks the trust store for recognized root CAs.

### mTLS
Client certificates presented during mutual TLS authentication are validated against the trust store.

### ACME
When UCM acts as an ACME client (Let's Encrypt), the trust store is used to verify the ACME CA's certificate.

  // ===================================================================
  importExport: {
    title: 'Import & Export',
    content: `
## Overview

Import certificates from external sources and export your PKI data for backup or migration.

## Smart Import

The Smart Import wizard auto-detects file types and processes them:

### Supported Formats
- **PEM** — Single or bundled certificates, CAs, and keys
- **DER** — Binary certificate or key
- **PKCS#12 (P12/PFX)** — Certificate + key + chain (requires password)
- **PKCS#7 (P7B)** — Certificate chain without keys

### How It Works
1. Click **Import** or drag files onto the drop zone
2. UCM analyzes each file and identifies its contents
3. Review the detected items (CAs, certificates, keys)
4. Click **Import** to add them to UCM

> 💡 Smart Import handles PEM bundles with multiple certificates in a single file. It automatically distinguishes CAs from end-entity certificates.

## OPNsense Integration

Sync certificates and CAs from an OPNsense firewall:

### Setup
1. In OPNsense, create an API key (System → Access → Users → API Keys)
2. In UCM, enter the OPNsense URL, API key, and API secret
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify

### Import
1. Click **Connect** to fetch available certificates and CAs
2. Select the items you want to import
3. Click **Import Selected**

UCM imports certificates with their private keys (if available) and preserves the CA hierarchy.

## Export Certificates

Bulk export all certificates:
- **PEM** — Individual PEM files
- **P7B Bundle** — All certificates in a single PKCS#7 file
- **ZIP** — All certificates as individual PEM files in a ZIP archive

## Export CAs

Bulk export all Certificate Authorities:
- **PEM** — Certificate chain in PEM format
- **Full chain** — Root → Intermediate → Sub-CA

## Migration Between UCM Instances

To migrate from one UCM instance to another:
1. Create a **backup** on the source (Settings → Backup)
2. Install UCM on the destination
3. **Restore** the backup on the destination

This preserves all data: certificates, CAs, keys, users, settings, and audit logs.

## Overview

A toolkit for inspecting, converting, and verifying certificates without leaving UCM.

## SSL Checker

Inspect a remote server's SSL/TLS certificate:

1. Enter the **hostname** (e.g., \`google.com\`)
2. Optionally change the **port** (default: 443)
3. Click **Check**

Results include:
- Certificate subject and issuer
- Validity dates
- SANs (Subject Alternative Names)
- Key type and size
- Full certificate chain
- TLS protocol version

## CSR Decoder

Parse and display CSR contents:

1. Paste a CSR in PEM format
2. Click **Decode**

Shows: Subject, SANs, key algorithm, key size, signature algorithm.

## Certificate Decoder

Parse and display certificate details:

1. Paste a certificate in PEM format
2. Click **Decode**

Shows: Subject, Issuer, SANs, validity, serial number, key usage, extensions, fingerprints.

## Key Matcher

Verify that a certificate, CSR, and private key belong together:

1. Paste the **certificate** PEM
2. Paste the **private key** PEM (optionally encrypted — provide password)
3. Optionally paste a **CSR** PEM
4. Click **Match**

UCM compares the modulus (RSA) or public key (EC) hashes. A match confirms they form a valid pair.

## Converter

Convert between certificate and key formats:

### PEM → DER
Converts a Base64-encoded PEM to binary DER format.

### PEM → PKCS#12
Creates a password-protected P12/PFX file from:
- Certificate PEM
- Private key PEM
- Optional chain certificates
- Password for the P12 file

### PKCS#12 → PEM
Extracts certificate, key, and chain from a P12 file:
- Upload the P12 file
- Enter the password
- Download the extracted PEM components

### PEM → PKCS#7
Bundles multiple certificates into a single P7B file (no keys).

> 💡 The converter preserves the full certificate chain when creating PKCS#12 files.

  hsm: {
    title: 'Hardware Security Modules',
    content: `
## Overview

Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) provide tamper-resistant storage for cryptographic keys. Private keys stored on an HSM never leave the hardware, providing the highest level of key protection.

## Supported Providers

### PKCS#11
The industry standard HSM interface. Supported devices:
- **Thales Luna** / **SafeNet**
- **Entrust nShield**
- **SoftHSM** (software-based, for testing)
- Any PKCS#11-compliant device

Configuration:
- **Library Path** — Path to the PKCS#11 shared library (.so/.dll)
- **Slot** — HSM slot number
- **PIN** — User PIN for authentication

### AWS CloudHSM
Amazon Web Services cloud-based HSM:
- **Cluster ID** — CloudHSM cluster identifier
- **Region** — AWS region
- **Credentials** — AWS access key and secret

### Azure Key Vault
Microsoft Azure managed key storage:
- **Vault URL** — Azure Key Vault endpoint

### Google Cloud KMS
Google Cloud Key Management Service:
- **Project** — GCP project ID
- **Location** — KMS key ring location
- **Key Ring** — Name of the key ring
- **Credentials** — Service account JSON key

## Managing Providers

### Adding a Provider
1. Click **Add Provider**
2. Select the **provider type**
3. Enter the connection details
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify
5. Click **Save**

### Testing Connection
Always test the connection after creating or modifying a provider. UCM verifies it can communicate with the HSM and authenticate.

### Provider Status
Each provider shows a connection status indicator:
- **Connected** — HSM is reachable and authenticated
- **Disconnected** — Cannot reach the HSM
- **Error** — Authentication or configuration issue

## Key Management

### Generating Keys
1. Select a connected provider
2. Click **Generate Key**
3. Choose the algorithm (RSA 2048/4096, ECDSA P-256/P-384)
4. Enter a key label/alias
5. Click **Generate**

The key is created directly on the HSM. UCM stores only a reference.

### Using HSM Keys
When creating a CA, select an HSM provider and key instead of generating a software key. The CA's signing operations are performed on the HSM.

> ⚠ Keys generated on an HSM cannot be exported. If you lose access to the HSM, you lose the keys.

> 💡 Use SoftHSM for development and testing before deploying with physical HSMs.

  sso: {
    title: 'Single Sign-On',
    content: `
## Overview

SSO allows users to authenticate using their organization's Identity Provider (IDP), eliminating the need for separate UCM credentials. UCM supports **SAML 2.0**, **OAuth2/OIDC**, and **LDAP**.

## SAML 2.0

### SP Metadata URL

UCM provides a **Service Provider (SP) Metadata URL** that you can give to your IDP for automatic configuration:

\`\`\`
https://your-ucm-host:8443/api/v2/sso/saml/metadata
\`\`\`

This URL returns a SAML 2.0 compliant XML document containing:
- **Entity ID** — UCM's service provider identifier
- **ACS URL** — Assertion Consumer Service endpoint (HTTP-POST)
- **SLO URL** — Single Logout Service endpoint
- **Signing Certificate** — UCM's HTTPS certificate for signing verification
- **NameID Format** — Requested name identifier format

Copy this URL into your IDP's "Add Service Provider" or "SAML Application" configuration.

> ⚠️ **Important:** UCM's HTTPS certificate must be **trusted by the IDP**. If the IDP cannot validate the certificate (e.g., self-signed or issued by a private CA), it will reject the metadata as invalid. Import UCM's CA certificate into the IDP's trust store, or use a certificate signed by a publicly trusted CA.

### Configuration
1. Obtain the IDP metadata URL or XML file from your identity provider
2. In UCM, go to **Settings → SSO**
3. Click **Add Provider** → SAML
4. Enter the **IDP Metadata URL** — UCM auto-populates Entity ID, SSO/SLO URLs, and certificate
5. Or paste the IDP metadata XML directly
6. Configure **attribute mapping** (username, email, groups)
7. Click **Save** and **Enable**

### Attribute Mapping
Map IDP SAML attributes to UCM user fields:
- \`username\` → UCM username (required)
- \`email\` → UCM email (required)
- \`groups\` → UCM group membership (optional)

## OAuth2 / OIDC

### Configuration
1. Register UCM as a client in your OAuth2/OIDC provider
2. Set the **Redirect URI** to: \`https://your-ucm-host:8443/api/v2/sso/callback/oauth2\`
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. In UCM, go to **Settings → SSO**
5. Click **Add Provider** → OAuth2
6. Enter the **Authorization URL** and **Token URL**
7. Enter the **User Info URL** (for fetching user attributes after login)
8. Enter Client ID and Secret
9. Configure scopes (openid, profile, email)
10. Click **Save** and **Enable**

### Auto-Create Users
When enabled, a new UCM user account is automatically created on first SSO login, using the IDP-provided attributes. The default role is assigned.

## LDAP

### Configuration
1. In UCM, go to **Settings → SSO**
2. Click **Add Provider** → LDAP
3. Enter the **LDAP Server** hostname and **Port** (389 for LDAP, 636 for LDAPS)
4. Enable **Use SSL** for encrypted connections
5. Enter the **Bind DN** and **Bind Password** (service account credentials)
6. Enter the **Base DN** (search base for user lookups)
7. Configure the **User Filter** (e.g., \`(uid={username})\` or \`(sAMAccountName={username})\` for AD)
8. Map LDAP attributes: **username**, **email**, **full name**
9. Click **Test Connection** to verify, then **Save** and **Enable**

### Active Directory
For Microsoft Active Directory, use:
- Port: **389** (or 636 with SSL)
- User Filter: \`(sAMAccountName={username})\`
- Username attr: \`sAMAccountName\`
- Email attr: \`mail\`
- Full name attr: \`displayName\`

## Login Flow
1. User clicks **Login with SSO** on the UCM login page (or enters LDAP credentials)
2. For SAML/OAuth2: user is redirected to the IDP, authenticates, then redirected back
3. For LDAP: credentials are verified directly against the LDAP server
4. UCM creates or updates the user account
5. User is logged in

> ⚠ Always keep at least one local admin account as fallback in case SSO misconfiguration locks everyone out.

> 💡 Test SSO with a non-admin account first before making it the primary authentication method.

> 💡 Use the **Test Connection** button to verify your configuration before enabling a provider.

> 💡 Enforce 2FA for admin accounts at minimum. Consider enforcing it for all users in security-sensitive environments.
`
  },

  // ===== GOVERNANCE =====

  policies: {
    title: 'Certificate Policies',
    content: `
## Overview

Certificate policies define the rules and constraints enforced when certificates are issued, renewed, or revoked. Policies are evaluated in **priority order** (lower number = higher precedence) and can be scoped to specific CAs.

## Policy Types

### Issuance Policies
Rules applied when new certificates are created. This is the most common type. Controls key types, validity periods, SAN restrictions, and whether approval is required.

### Renewal Policies
Rules applied when certificates are renewed. Can enforce shorter validity on renewal or require re-approval.

### Revocation Policies
Rules applied when certificates are revoked. Can require approval before revocation of critical certificates.

## Rules Configuration

### Max Validity
Maximum certificate lifetime in days. Common values:
- **90 days** — Short-lived automation (ACME-style)
- **397 days** — CA/Browser Forum baseline for public TLS
- **730 days** — Internal/private PKI
- **365 days** — Code signing

### Allowed Key Types
Restrict which key algorithms and sizes can be used:
- **RSA-2048** — Minimum for public trust
- **RSA-4096** — Higher security, larger certificates
- **EC-P256** — Modern, fast, recommended
- **EC-P384** — Higher security elliptic curve
- **EC-P521** — Maximum security (rarely needed)

### SAN Restrictions
- **Max DNS Names** — Limit the number of Subject Alternative Names
- **DNS Pattern** — Restrict to specific domain patterns (e.g. \`*.company.com\`)

## Approval Workflows

When **Require Approval** is enabled, certificate issuance is paused until the required number of approvers from the assigned group have approved the request.

### Configuration
- **Approval Group** — Select a user group responsible for approvals
- **Min Approvers** — Number of approvals required (e.g. 2 of 3 group members)
- **Notifications** — Alert administrators when policies are violated

> 💡 Use approval workflows for high-value certificates like code signing and wildcard certificates.

## Priority System

Policies are evaluated in priority order. Lower numbers have higher precedence:
- **1–10** — Critical security policies (code signing, wildcard)
- **10–20** — Standard compliance (public TLS, internal PKI)
- **20+** — Permissive defaults

When multiple policies match a certificate request, the highest-priority (lowest number) policy wins.

## Scope

### All CAs
Policy applies to every CA in the system. Use for organization-wide rules.

### Specific CA
Policy applies only to certificates issued by the selected CA. Use for granular control.

## Default Policies

UCM ships with 5 built-in policies reflecting real-world PKI best practices:
- **Code Signing** (priority 5) — Strong keys, approval required
- **Wildcard Certificates** (priority 8) — Approval required, max 10 SANs
- **Web Server TLS** (priority 10) — CA/B Forum compliant, 397-day max
- **Short-Lived Automation** (priority 15) — 90-day ACME-style
- **Internal PKI** (priority 20) — 730-day, relaxed rules

> 💡 Customize or disable default policies to match your organization's requirements.
`
  },

  approvals: {
    title: 'Approval Requests',
    content: `
## Overview

The Approvals page shows all certificate requests that require manual approval before issuance. Approval workflows are configured in **Policies** — when a policy has "Require Approval" enabled, any matching certificate request creates an approval request here.

## Request Lifecycle

### Pending
The request is awaiting review. The certificate cannot be issued until the required number of approvers have approved it. Pending requests appear first by default.

### Approved
All required approvals have been received. The certificate will be issued automatically once approved.

### Rejected
Any single rejection immediately stops the request. The certificate will not be issued. A rejection comment is required to explain the reason.

### Expired
The request was not reviewed before the deadline. Expired requests must be re-submitted.

## Approving a Request

1. Click a pending request to view its details
2. Review the certificate details, requester, and associated policy
3. Click **Approve** and optionally add a comment
4. The approval is recorded with your username and timestamp

## Rejecting a Request

1. Click a pending request to view its details
2. Click **Reject**
3. Enter a **rejection reason** (required) — this is logged for audit compliance
4. The request is immediately stopped

> ⚠ Any single rejection stops the entire request. This is intentional — if any reviewer identifies a problem, issuance should not proceed.

## Approval History

Each request maintains a complete approval timeline showing:
- Who approved or rejected (username)
- When the action was taken (timestamp)
- Comment provided (if any)

This history is immutable and part of the audit trail.

## Filtering

Use the status filter bar at the top to show:
- **Pending** — Requests awaiting your review
- **Approved** — Recently approved requests
- **Rejected** — Rejected requests with reasons
- **Total** — All requests regardless of status

## Permissions

- **read:approvals** — View approval requests
- **write:approvals** — Approve or reject requests

> 💡 Set up email notifications in policies so approvers are alerted when new requests arrive.

### Test Send
Before enabling schedules, use the ✈️ button on any report card to send a test report to a specific email address. This verifies that SMTP is configured correctly and the report format meets your needs.

> ⚠ Scheduled reports require SMTP to be configured in **Settings → Email**. Test send will fail if SMTP is not set up.

## Permissions
