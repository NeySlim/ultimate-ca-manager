### 🐛 Fixed

1. **CA Details DN Fields Display** (Critical)
   - Fixed "N/A" display for all DN fields (organization, country, state, etc.)
   - Root cause: CA model returned only subject string, not parsed fields
   - Solution: Added 9 computed properties to parse DN components
   - Impact: All CA details now display correctly

2. **CA Export Menu Table Overflow** (Major)
   - Fixed table cell expansion when opening export menu
   - Root cause: Position absolute confined to table cell
   - Solution: Changed to position fixed with getBoundingClientRect()
   - Impact: Menu displays cleanly without layout issues

3. **System Configuration Path Display** (Major)
   - Fixed hardcoded development paths showing in system info
   - Root cause: 10 hardcoded `/root/ucm-src` paths in ui_routes.py
   - Solution: Replaced with Config.DATABASE_PATH, etc.
   - Impact: Displays correct `/opt/ucm` installation paths

4. **Managed Certificate Dropdown Empty** (Major)
   - Fixed dropdown showing no certificates
   - Root cause: Filter checked non-existent `crt` field
   - Solution: Check serial_number, valid_from, has_private_key
   - Impact: 26+ certificates now display in dropdown

5. **Logout Method Not Allowed** (Major)
   - Fixed "Method Not Allowed" error on logout
   - Root cause: Route only accepted POST, JS used GET
   - Solution: Accept both GET and POST methods
   - Impact: Logout works from all contexts

6. **User Role Display Incorrect** (Major)
   - Fixed role showing "viewer" instead of "admin"
   - Root cause: Incorrect API response parsing
   - Solution: Access nested user.role field
   - Impact: User menu shows correct role

7. **User ID Extraction** (Minor)
   - Fixed user ID not extracted from login response
   - Root cause: Incorrect nesting in API response
   - Solution: Access data.user.id instead of data.id
   - Impact: User session properly tracks user ID

8. **Session Expiration Handling** (Minor)
   - Improved session timeout behavior
   - Added proper redirect to login page
   - Better error messages

9. **Configuration Module Imports** (Minor)
   - Added proper Config and DATA_DIR imports
   - Centralized configuration access
   - Eliminated hardcoded paths

10. **Certificate Status Indicators** (Verified)
    - Confirmed CRT/KEY badges work correctly
    - No fix needed, working as designed

### 🔒 Security

- Comprehensive security audit completed
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities (SQLAlchemy ORM only)
